## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 4 Example 4: layable Maze (JSON + Level class + Player class)

---

## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han. Changed made to code by Oma Tahir using GENAI

---

## Description

Using AI, in the third level the player is now faced with two moving obstecles. They must sucseully avoid touching them and getting to the other safe side or else they will have to re-start the level again.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

## GenAI
